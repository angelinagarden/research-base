Abstract:
This study presents novel machine learning techniques for predicting climate change patterns using satellite data and atmospheric measurements. We developed a deep learning model that can forecast temperature variations with 95% accuracy over a 5-year period.

Keywords: machine learning, climate change, deep learning, satellite data, prediction

Introduction:
Climate change represents one of the most pressing challenges of our time. Traditional meteorological models have limitations in capturing the complex interactions between atmospheric variables. This research introduces advanced machine learning approaches to improve prediction accuracy.

Methodology:
We collected satellite data from NASA's MODIS and Landsat missions spanning 20 years. The data includes temperature, humidity, pressure, and wind speed measurements. We trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) combined with a long short-term memory (LSTM) network to capture both spatial and temporal patterns.

Results:
Our model achieved 95% accuracy in predicting temperature variations, compared to 78% accuracy of traditional models. The system can predict climate patterns up to 5 years in advance with high confidence.

Conclusion:
Machine learning approaches show significant promise for climate change prediction. Future work will focus on incorporating more variables and extending the prediction horizon.
